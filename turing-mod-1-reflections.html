        <h2>A quick retrospective on Turing's first module</h2>
        <p>
          I am writing this entry in an effort to gather some of my thoughts as I prepare for the second module. Specifically I am having a sort
          of retrospective on my entire Module 1 experience at Turing. One of the major themes at Turing, it seems, is struggle. This struggle can
          take many forms - technical, emotional, physical, etc. - and I experienced each to varying degrees. Module 1 pushed me in ways that I had
          not experienced prior. Each weekly struggle often felt like the limit, and yet I was able to persevere. I am confident that my survival would
          not have been possible had it not been for a great deal of support from my fellow students, the instructional team, my family, and perhaps
          most importantly, the idea of growth mindset.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turing introduced me to the idea of growth mindset the first week, and I am immensely thankful. Growth mindset is an alternative to the
          state of mind that many of us have grown up within - fixed mindset.
