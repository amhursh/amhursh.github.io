        <h2>A quick retrospective on Turing's first module</h2>
        <p>
          I am writing this entry in an effort to gather some of my thoughts as I prepare for the second module. Specifically I am having a sort
          of retrospective on my entire Module 1 experience at Turing. One of the major themes at Turing, it seems, is struggle. This struggle can
          take many forms - technical, emotional, physical, etc. - and I experienced each to varying degrees. Module 1 pushed me in ways that I had
          not experienced prior. Each weekly struggle often felt like the limit, and yet I was able to persevere. I am confident that my survival would
          not have been possible had it not been for a great deal of support from my fellow students, the instructional team, my family, and perhaps
          most importantly, the idea of growth mindset.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turing introduced me to the idea of growth mindset the first week, and I am immensely thankful. Growth mindset is an alternative to the
          state of mind that many of us have grown up within - fixed mindset. In a fixed mindset, we find ourselves determining success or failure on
          grades, outcomes, or results. Like most American students, I spent the vast majority of my academic life obsessively focused on grades.
          If I received good grades, I was satisfied. If I received bad grades, I was discouraged. I was motivated not by the actual accumulation
          of knowledge or the process of growth, but rather by the marks I would receive, good or bad. Of course this was not clear to me at the time,
          but it crystalizes once you have experienced the alternative. Growth mindset is all about the journey. Instead of focusing on grades, it is
          important to embrace the learning experience itself - that is, everything that happens <em>between</em> the grades. The goal is to be able
          to draw encouragement and positive feedback not from grades, which are by definition an often perverse reduction of the work, but rather from
          being able to retrospectively examine one's growth. Even most of those who would not have been seen as successful in traditional terms can
          see growth and draw motivation from that growth, and hopefully feel some degree of success. I found myself obsessed with collecting skills
          and knowledge, building a record of growth, not a collection of flattering letters or numbers. The growth mindset is so helpful because it
          never rests. You don't coast when you are confident, and you don't resign when frustrated. The magic of this all is that the growth mindset
          actually produces <em>better results</em> (or grades/marks in concrete terms), something that I experienced first hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned so many technical skills during my first module at Turing. Though I can always improve on my skills (all developers can), I am
          confident that I have the base skillset to approach and solve problems with effeciency and style. I know the syntax. I built pair coding
          skills and a solid understanding of test-driven development. All that said, what I value most from my first module, though, is the ability
          to look back at the state of my work from week one, and see so clearly my growth trajectory. When I retrospectively examine my journey, and
          recognize the growth, I am filled with confidence that I can grow so much, and awed by just how much more growth I surely have in front of me.
          It seeds a hunger for growth and skill accumulation that forms the core of my identity as a developer and person. I think that core mindset
          will be the tool that is most valuable to me in the remaining modules, in my career, and in life. The world of tech and software development
          is not static - it is constantly evolving, and we need to always be ready to move with that change.
